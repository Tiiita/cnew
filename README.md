## C Project Creator

A simple script which lets you create new projects in the C language much easier. It creates a gitignore, main.c and Makefile (makefile compiles using GCC by default)

### How to use it:

Clone the repository using ``git clone https://github.com/Tiiita/cnew.git`` 
Navigate to the directory that matches your operating system:
  - macos, linux => unix  
  - windows => windows  
Double click the ``installer.sh`` / ``installer.bat``.  
DONE!  

You now have a new command installed on your computer.  
You can now just navigate to the place you want to create a new project and do ```cnew PRROJECT_NAME```.  

Thats it.
